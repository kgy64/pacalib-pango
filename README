PaCaLib-Pango: my 2D rendering library implementation for Linux
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is an object-oriented interface to draw graphics primitives including lines, circles, text, etc...
The Pango/Cairo based implementation for Linux and Unix-like operating systems.

Based on the following external libraries:
- cairo     www.cairographics.org                   For rendering graphics primitives
- pango     www.pango.org                           For rendering international text
- makesys   https://github.com/kgy64/makesys.git        My build system
